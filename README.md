# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-using-YOLO-Algorithm
# Trained a real-time machine learning model using the YOLO algorithm within a strict 36-hour timeline.
# Enhanced a driver drowsiness detection system, achieving an 89% accuracy rate in real-time detection during vehicleoperation. 
# Implemented alerts that led to 30% reduction in potential accidents caused by driver fatigue.
